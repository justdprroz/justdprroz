### Hello there I am Dmitri Proskuriakov commonly reffered as JustDprroz

I am interested in writing code in "low" level languages like C, Rust and maybe C++

Projects I worked on:
* [Simple 2d game](https://github.com/justdprroz/TwilightEscapers) with own [engine](https://github.com/justdprroz/sequoia-engine) using SFML with C++ (Orphaned because I quite lost interest for gamedev especially in C++)
* [Backend for VPN management web app](https://github.com/silaeder/silaeder-vpn) with backend in rust. Kinda abandoned project because current functionality is sufficient for me
* Several snake games. [First](https://github.com/justdprroz/AwesomeSnake) in C/C++ using SFML. [Second](https://github.com/justdprroz/rusty-snake) in Rust using CLI. This projects were quick ways to learn some concepts of networking, threading, CLIs

Projects I currently working on:
* [Window manager for X server](https://github.com/justdprroz/rtde) written in Rust! Intention of this project is to replicate [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org) in Rust with learning how window manager works and how to implement some system-level stuff in Rust. **Would really appreciate any feedback**

I like computer science and everything related to computers and here is what I like and why
* At this time I am learning Rust language. I love this language brigns developers great experience of writing software without thinking of night-long debugging sessions
* I am a bit interested in Networking and in the ways how to build them. I find networking to be intersting and important part of computer science because networks are everythere from your house to google data centers
* I like mechanical keyboards because there kinda nerdy and also I can learn MCU programming while working with them _(keyboard project will be soon)_
* I really love software written according to UNIX philosophy, because quaility > quantity. Having a lot of buggy stuff will make your workflow slower, more annoying and generally uncomfortable

Some facts about me:
* I enjoy computer games because they can bring me experience that I can never achieve in my life. Some of them are: Minecraft, Terraria, Satisfactory, Red Dead Redemption 2, Cities Skylines, Civilization IV
* I really love listening to music.
